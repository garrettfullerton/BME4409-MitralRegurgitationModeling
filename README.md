# BME4409-MitralRegurgitationModeling
## By Garrett Fullerton, Andrea Lopez, Duc Tran
## Modifications made from previous code provided by user S19 BENG 189: https://github.com/s19-beng-189/module-1-group-project-regurgitation

## Mitral valve regurgitation or insufficiency is a condition in which the mitral valve does not shut tightly resulting in backflow into the left atrium
## Here, we model the cardiovascular parameters of mitral flow, left ventricular pressure-volume loops, and systemic pulse pressure under increasing severity of mitral valve regurgitation.
## The folder "cardiac-model-simpler" stores all the various codes used to model mitral valve regurgitation present in the final report and final presentation
## Use of MATLAB is needed to run the .m files.
